# 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores how much we can improve popular machine learning classifiers by tuning their hyperparameters with Optuna compared to just using the default settings.  
We work with a real-world dataset to predict income categories, going through all the steps: data cleaning, encoding, splitting, training, and evaluation.

The notebook includes a wide variety of classification models—like 📈 Logistic Regression, 📧 Naive Bayes, 🌳 Decision Tree, 🌲 Random Forest, 🕸️ SVM, 👨‍👩‍👦 KNN, ⚡ XGBoost, 🅰️ AdaBoost, 💡 LightGBM, and 🐱 CatBoost. For each model, we compare the classification results between the plain default parameters and the best hyperparameters suggested by Optuna.

This side-by-side comparison helps show how much of a difference smart hyperparameter tuning can make, and which models benefit most from it.  
The whole workflow is explained with simple code and clear visualizations so it’s easy to follow for anyone interested in practical ML model optimization. 🚀

# 🔄 Workflow Summary

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

We start by loading the dataset and checking for missing values.  
Any missing or ambiguous entries (including special symbols like ‘?’) are replaced with the most common value for that column.  
All categorical features are encoded into numbers so that the machine learning models can work with them easily.  
We also handle outliers by capping them at the edges of the acceptable range, instead of removing any data.  
Finally, we split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80:20 split.

---

## 📏 Evaluation Strategy

For each classifier, we train the model twice: once with default parameters and once with the best parameters found using Optuna.
The models are tested on the same hold-out test set for a fair comparison.
We use accuracy as the main metric, and also include precision, recall, F1 score, a classification report, and the confusion matrix for more detailed insights.
All results are visualized using clear bar charts and tables, making it easy to see which models and settings perform best.


Each model is evaluated using:

| Metric         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Accuracy       | Overall correctness |
| Precision      | Correctness on positive predictions |
| Recall (Sensitivity) | Coverage of actual positives |
| F1 Score       | Harmonic mean of precision and recall |
| Confusion Matrix | Detailed class-wise prediction counts |

---

### 📐 Metric Formulas

Let:
- TP = True Positives  
- TN = True Negatives  
- FP = False Positives  
- FN = False Negatives
  
**Accuracy**
```math
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
```
**Precision**
```math
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
```

**Recall**
```math
\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}

## 📈 Logistic Regression

## ⚙️ Logistic Regression Parameters Explained

| Parameter           | What It Does                                                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `solver`            | Algorithm to use for optimization (e.g., `'liblinear'`, `'lbfgs'`, etc.)     |
| `penalty`           | Type of regularization to prevent overfitting (e.g., `'l1'`, `'l2'`)         |
| `dual`              | If `True`, uses the dual formulation (only for `'l2'` when n_features < n_samples) |
| `C`                 | Inverse of regularization strength. Smaller values = stronger regularization |
| `max_iter`          | Maximum number of iterations for the solver to converge                      |
| `fit_intercept`     | If `True`, adds an intercept (bias) term to the model                        |

## 🧑‍🏫 How Logistic Regression Works

**Logistic Regression** is a simple and widely-used method for binary classification.

It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class (like **"yes" or "no"**, **"spam" or "not spam"**).

---

### 🧮 Prediction Formula

It works by computing a linear combination of input features:

```math
z = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \ldots + w_nx_n
```

- \( ```w_0```) is the intercept (bias)
- \(```w_1, w_2, ..., w_n ```) are the weights (coefficients) for each input feature ```( x_1, x_2,.. ,x_n )```

---

### 📉 Sigmoid Function

This value ```z``` is passed through a **sigmoid** function:

```math
P(\text{class}=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
```

This squashes the output into the range (0, 1), making it interpretable as a probability.

---

### ✅ Decision Rule

If:

```math
P(\text{class}=1) > 0.5
```

→ predict **class 1**,  
else → predict **class 0**

---

### 🛡️ Role of Regularization

Regularization helps prevent overfitting by discouraging large weights:

- Controlled via the **`C`** parameter (lower values → more regularization)
- Type is set using **`penalty`** (e.g., `'l1'`, `'l2'`)

---

## 📧 Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes classifiers are fast and simple algorithms that predict classes based on probabilities.  
They are called “naive” because they assume all features are independent given the class  
(which is rarely perfectly true, but works well in practice!).

---

### GaussianNB (Gaussian Naive Bayes)

**Best For**: Data where features are continuous (real-valued), like age, height, or income.  
**How it Works**: Assumes each feature follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution for each class.

#### Prediction Formula:
For each class, calculates:

```math
P(\text{class} \mid \text{features}) \propto P(\text{class}) \times \prod_i P(\text{feature}_i \mid \text{class})
```

Where \( P(\text{feature}_i \mid \text{class}) \) is computed using the Gaussian (bell curve) formula:

```math
P(x \mid \text{class}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \cdot \exp\left( -\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
```

- \( \mu \) = mean of feature for that class  
- \( \sigma^2 \) = variance for that feature/class

**Example**: Used for iris flower classification, spam detection with continuous inputs, and medical data.

---

### MultinomialNB (Multinomial Naive Bayes)

**Best For**: Features are counts (e.g., number of times a word appears), like document classification and text data.  
**How it Works**: Assumes features are drawn from a multinomial distribution (like word frequencies in emails).

#### Prediction Formula:
For each class, calculates:

```math
P(\text{class} \mid \text{features}) \propto P(\text{class}) \times \prod_i P(\text{feature}_i \mid \text{class})^{\text{count}_i}
```

Where:  
- \( P(\text{feature}_i \mid \text{class}) \) = probability of word \( i \) appearing in class  
- \( \text{count}_i \) = number of times feature \( i \) appears

**Example**: Used in spam filtering, sentiment analysis, document categorization.

---

### BernoulliNB (Bernoulli Naive Bayes)

**Best For**: Features are binary (0 or 1; yes/no, present/absent), such as whether a word appears in an email.  
**How it Works**: Assumes each feature is present (1) or absent (0), and uses the Bernoulli (coin flip) probability model.

#### Prediction Formula:
For each class, calculates:

```math
P(\text{class} \mid \text{features}) \propto P(\text{class}) \times \prod_i P(x_i \mid \text{class})
```

- For feature present: \( P(\text{feature}_i = 1 \mid \text{class}) \)  
- For feature absent: \( 1 - P(\text{feature}_i = 1 \mid \text{class}) \)

**Example**: Used for binary text data, like spam detection or review positivity.

---

| Variant        | Feature Type       | Common Uses                          | Probability Formula                       |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| GaussianNB     | Continuous numbers | Medical, sensor, iris, etc.          | Gaussian (bell curve):                    |
| MultinomialNB  | Counts/integers    | Text, NLP, word counts               | Multinomial:                              |

## 🌳 Decision Tree

A **Decision Tree classifier** splits data into branches based on feature values, creating a “tree” of decisions.  
At each node, it asks a question about a feature; based on the answer, it moves **left or right**.  
This continues until it reaches a **leaf** node that gives a prediction.

---

## ⚙️ Key Parameters in `DecisionTreeClassifier`

| Parameter                  | What It Does                                                                 |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `criterion`                | Function to measure split quality. Common: `'gini'` (Gini impurity), `'entropy'` (information gain) |
| `splitter`                 | Strategy to choose the split at each node (`'best'` or `'random'`)           |
| `max_depth`               | Maximum depth of the tree (how many questions/levels). Prevents overfitting. |
| `min_samples_split`       | Minimum number of samples required to split a node                           |
| `min_samples_leaf`        | Minimum number of samples required at a leaf node                            |
| `min_weight_fraction_leaf`| Minimum weighted fraction of total input samples at a leaf node              |
| `max_features`            | Number of features to consider when searching for the best split             |
| `max_leaf_nodes`          | Limits number of leaf nodes in the tree                                      |
| `min_impurity_decrease`   | Minimum impurity decrease required to make a split                           |

| `ccp_alpha`               | Complexity parameter for **Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning**                 |

---

## 🌱 How Decision Trees Work (In Simple Steps)

1. **Pick the Best Question**  
   At the root, the tree selects the feature and threshold that best separates the data.

2. **Split the Data**  
   Data is divided into two groups based on the answer to the question.

3. **Repeat**  
   Each group becomes a new node; the process repeats recursively.

4. **Stop Splitting When**:
   - Maximum depth is reached
   - A node is pure (all samples of one class)
   - Too few samples remain to split

5. **Make a Prediction**  
   The class label at the **leaf node** becomes the prediction.

---

## 📐 How Splitting Works: Gini Impurity and Entropy

### 🔸 Gini Impurity (Default)

Gini measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element:

```math
Gini = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i^2
```

Where:
- \( p_i \) is the probability of class \( i \) at that node
- \( C \) is the number of classes

---

### 🔹 Entropy (Information Gain)

Entropy measures disorder or uncertainty in the split:

```math
Entropy = - \sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i \cdot \log_2(p_i)
```

- Lower entropy means purer node  
- Information Gain = Reduction in entropy due to a split

---

## ✅ Summary

- Decision Trees are **easy to interpret**
- Can handle **both numerical and categorical features**
- Suitable for **small to medium-sized datasets**
- Susceptible to **overfitting**, but tunable via parameters like `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `ccp_alpha`

## 🌲 Random Forest
# 🌲 Random Forest Classifier Explained

A **Random Forest** is an ensemble method that builds a collection (a “forest”) of decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and stability.

It helps reduce overfitting and works well for both **classification** and **regression** problems.

---

## ⚙️ Key Parameters in `RandomForestClassifier`

| Parameter                  | What It Does                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `n_estimators`            | Number of decision trees in the forest. More trees can increase accuracy.    |
| `criterion`               | Function to measure split quality (`gini` or `entropy`).                     |
| `max_depth`               | Maximum depth (levels) of each tree. Controls overfitting.                   |
| `min_samples_split`       | Minimum samples needed to split a node.                                      |
| `min_samples_leaf`        | Minimum samples at a leaf node.                                              |
| `min_weight_fraction_leaf`| Minimum weighted fraction of samples at a leaf.                              |
| `max_features`            | Features to consider when splitting (`sqrt`, `log2`, or number).             |
| `max_leaf_nodes`          | Maximum number of leaf nodes per tree.                                       |

| `ccp_alpha`               | Complexity parameter for pruning (helps reduce overfitting).                 |

---

## 🌳 How Random Forest Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Build Many Trees  
Random Forest creates many decision trees, each trained on a **random sample** of the data (with replacement).

### 2. Random Feature Selection  
At each node split, a **random subset of features** is selected.  
This encourages **diversity** between the trees.

### 3. Make Predictions  
- **Classification**: Each tree votes for a class; the **majority vote** wins.  
- **Regression**: Takes the **average** of all tree outputs.

### 4. Combine Results  
All tree predictions are combined to give a more **accurate and robust final prediction**, reducing overfitting.

---

## 🌟 Why Use Random Forest?

- ✅ Handles both **numerical and categorical** features.
- ✅ Performs well with **irrelevant or redundant** features.
- ✅ Provides **feature importance scores**.
- ✅ Less prone to **overfitting** compared to single decision trees.
- ✅ Works well **out of the box** with minimal tuning.

---

## 📝 Simple Formula for Prediction (Classification)

Let `Pred₁, Pred₂, ..., Predₙ` be predictions from `n` trees.

```math
\text{Final Class} = \text{mode}(Pred_1, Pred_2, ..., Pred_N)
```
That is, the class that receives the majority of votes is the predicted label.

🎯 Summary
Random Forest is a powerful and flexible algorithm suitable for many classification and regression problems.
It’s highly accurate, easy to use, and effective on small and large datasets alike.

## 🕸️ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
# 🕸️ Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier (SVC) Explained

SVC (**Support Vector Classifier**) is a powerful method for classification.

It tries to find the best boundary (called a **“hyperplane”**) that separates different classes of data, with the **widest possible margin**.

---

## ⚙️ Key Parameters in SVC

| Parameter      | What It Does |
|----------------|--------------|
| `C`            | Regularization parameter: higher values mean **less regularization** (model tries harder to classify all points correctly, but may overfit). Lower values allow **more misclassifications**, making the boundary smoother. |
| `kernel`       | Function used to transform the data into higher dimensions to make it separable (e.g., `'linear'`, `'rbf'`, `'poly'`, `'sigmoid'`). Most common is `'rbf'` (Radial Basis Function). |
| `degree`       | Degree of the polynomial kernel (**used only if** `kernel='poly'`). |
| `gamma`        | Controls how far the influence of a single training example reaches (**used for** `'rbf'`, `'poly'`, and `'sigmoid'` kernels). Low values: far; high values: close. |
| `coef0`        | Independent term in kernel function (**used for** `'poly'` and `'sigmoid'` kernels). |
| `probability`  | If `True`, enables **probability estimates** (slower, but gives class probabilities). |
| `shrinking`    | Whether to use the **shrinking heuristic** for speed (usually `True`). |
| `tol`          | Tolerance for **stopping criterion**. |
| `max_iter`     | **Maximum number of iterations** (`-1` for unlimited). |
| `class_weight` | Weights for classes (helps with **imbalanced datasets**). |
| `random_state` | Controls **randomness** for reproducibility. |

---

## 🏃‍♂️ How SVC Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Draw the Best Boundary
SVC looks for the **“hyperplane”** (a line in 2D, a plane in 3D, etc.) that separates classes with the **widest margin**. Only the closest points (the **support vectors**) influence its position.

### 2. Transform Data if Needed
If the data isn’t linearly separable, SVC can use a **“kernel” function** to map it into a **higher dimension** where it is separable.

### 3. Make Predictions
New data points are classified based on which **side of the boundary** they fall.

---

## 📐 Main Formulas

### Linear SVC:

```math
f(x) = sign(w · x + b)
```
- `w`: vector of model weights  
- `x`: input feature vector  
- `b`: intercept (bias)  
- `sign()`: returns the class label (+1 or -1)

---

### Kernel SVC:
```math
f(x) = sign(Σ αᵢ yᵢ K(xᵢ, x) + b)
```
- `αᵢ`: support vector coefficients  
- `yᵢ`: class labels for support vectors  
- `K`: kernel function  
- `xᵢ`: support vectors

---

## 🌟 Why Use SVC?

- ✔️ Works well for **complex boundaries** and **high-dimensional data**  
- ✔️ Effective when there’s a **clear margin** between classes  
- ✔️ Supports multiple **kernel functions** for flexibility  
- ✔️ Great for **small to medium-sized datasets** with complex decision surfaces

> **SVC** is a robust and flexible classifier, especially effective when your data is not linearly separable or when you require **high classification accuracy** in smaller datasets.


## 👨‍👩‍👦 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
# 👨‍👩‍👦 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier Explained

The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier is a simple, “instance-based” learning algorithm.

It makes predictions for a new data point by looking at the **‘k’ closest neighbors** in the training data and choosing the **most common class** among them.

---

## ⚙️ Key Parameters in `KNeighborsClassifier`

| Parameter       | What It Does                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `n_neighbors`   | Number of nearest neighbors to consider (the “k” in KNN).                    |
| `weights`       | Voting weight: `'uniform'` (equal) or `'distance'` (closer gets more weight).|
| `algorithm`     | Method to compute nearest neighbors: `'auto'`, `'ball_tree'`, `'kd_tree'`, `'brute'`. |
| `leaf_size`     | Leaf size for `ball_tree` and `kd_tree`; affects speed.                      |
| `metric`        | Distance metric to use (default: `'minkowski'`).                             |
| `p`             | Power parameter for Minkowski: `p=2` is Euclidean, `p=1` is Manhattan.        |
| `n_jobs`        | Number of parallel jobs to run (speed-up computation).                       |

---

## 🏃‍♂️ How KNN Works (Step by Step)

### 1. Choose `k`  
Decide how many neighbors to consider (e.g., `k=5`).

### 2. Measure Distance  
Use a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean) to compute distance between the new point and every point in the training data.

### 3. Find Nearest Neighbors  
Pick the `k` closest points based on the calculated distances.

### 4. Vote  
Assign the class that is **most common** among those `k` neighbors.

---

## 📐 Common Distance Formula

**Euclidean Distance** (most common):

```math
\text{distance} = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + \ldots + (x_n - y_n)^2}
```

🌟 Why Use KNN?
⚡ No training time — KNN is a lazy learner

🧠 Easy to understand and explain to non-technical audiences

🔍 Handles complex decision boundaries without assumptions

✅ Great for small-to-medium datasets

🧪 Good baseline model before jumping to complex algorithms

## ⚡ XGBoost
# ⚡ XGBoost Classifier Explained

**XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a fast and powerful machine learning algorithm that builds an **ensemble of decision trees**, each trying to fix the mistakes of the previous ones.

It’s one of the most popular methods for **tabular data**, known for its speed and performance.

## 🏃‍♂️ How XGBoost Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Start with a Guess
- XGBoost begins by making an **initial prediction**.
    - For regression: usually the mean.
    - For classification: log odds of the target variable.

### 2. Build Trees in Sequence
- Each new tree is trained to predict the **residual errors** from the previous iteration.
- This way, the model focuses on the samples where it made mistakes.

### 3. Combine the Trees
- Final prediction is the **sum of outputs** from all the trees.
- Each tree's prediction is **weighted by the learning rate**.

### 4. Use Regularization
- XGBoost adds **penalties for complex trees** to avoid overfitting.
- Both **L1** (`reg_alpha`) and **L2** (`reg_lambda`) regularization are supported.

---

## 📐 Main Formula

### 🔸 Prediction:

```python
ŷ = f₁(x) + f₂(x) + ... + fₙ(x)
```
Total Loss = ∑ Loss(true, predicted) + Regularization
Loss: Measures how far off predictions are from the truth.

Regularization: Penalizes overly complex models to improve generalization.

🌟 Why Use XGBoost?
✅ Automatically handles missing values

✅ Supports both L1 and L2 regularization

✅ Fast and scalable, suitable for large datasets

✅ Frequently wins machine learning competitions

✅ Works well out-of-the-box for structured/tabular data

XGBoost is a go-to choice for anyone looking to apply machine learning to structured datasets with high accuracy and speed.

## 🅰️ AdaBoost
# 🅰️ AdaBoost Classifier Explained

**AdaBoost** (Adaptive Boosting) is an **ensemble method** that combines many simple models (**weak learners**, usually decision stumps) to create a **strong overall classifier**.

Each new model focuses more on the examples previous models got wrong, making the final prediction more accurate.

---

## ⚙️ Key Parameters in `AdaBoostClassifier`

| Parameter         | What It Does |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `n_estimators`    | Number of weak learners (usually shallow trees) to build. |
| `learning_rate`   | Shrinks the contribution of each model. Lower values can improve performance but may require more estimators. |
| `base_estimator`  | Type of weak learner to use (default is a one-level decision tree, also called a **decision stump**). |
| `algorithm`       | Type of AdaBoost algorithm:<br>• `'SAMME'` for multiclass classification<br>• `'SAMME.R'` for probability-based boosting (default) |
| `random_state`    | Seed for reproducibility. |

---

## 🏃‍♂️ How AdaBoost Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Start with Equal Weights
- Every training sample is given **equal weight** at the beginning.

### 2. Build a Weak Learner
- Train a simple model (like a decision stump) on the dataset.

### 3. Update Weights
- **Increase the weights** of misclassified samples so the next learner focuses more on them.

### 4. Repeat
- Continue training new weak learners, each time paying more attention to **hard-to-classify** points.

### 5. Combine Models
- The final prediction is a **weighted vote** of all weak learners.

---

## 📐 Main Formula

The final prediction is based on a **weighted majority vote**:

```python
Final Prediction = sign(Σ (αₜ × predictionₜ))
```

αₜ: Weight assigned to the t-th weak learner (based on its error rate)

predictionₜ: Class predicted by the t-th weak learner

Misclassified points get higher weights for the next boosting round.

🌟 Why Use AdaBoost?
✅ Turns weak learners into a strong classifier

✅ Works well for both binary and multiclass classification

✅ Simple and effective, especially when using decision stumps

✅ Boosts performance without much tuning

AdaBoost is a powerful and interpretable boosting algorithm that can significantly improve classification accuracy, especially with simple base models.

## 💡 Discussion & Insights
The results from our comprehensive comparison show that hyperparameter tuning with Optuna generally leads to measurable improvements across most classifiers. While some models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost already perform well out-of-the-box, careful tuning consistently squeezed out additional performance—sometimes yielding gains of up to 1-2% in accuracy and F1 score.

A key insight is that simpler models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, although interpretable and fast, benefit less from tuning than ensemble models. On the other hand, tree-based methods and boosting algorithms (🌳, ⚡, 🐱) were more sensitive to hyperparameter choices. This underscores the importance of tuning when using more complex or powerful classifiers.

In summary, while default settings provide a strong starting point, leveraging automated hyperparameter optimization tools like Optuna is a practical and efficient way to maximize model performance. These findings emphasize the value of systematic experimentation in applied machine learning projects. 🚀
